# Detecting Fake News Articles And Performing Text Summarisation Using Machine Learning

This experimental project was built in the Python programming language and various machine learning libraries to train different classifiers to detect fake news and perform text summarisation.

There are total five experimental setups all included in one Jupyter notebook.

# Machine Learning Model
1. Support Vector Machine
2. Logistic Regression
3. Gaussian Naive Bayes
4. Long Short-Term Memory Networks

# Text Normalisation Techniques
1. Potter Stemmer
2. Lemmatisation

# Text Vectorisation Techniques
1. CountVectorizer
2. Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) 
3. Word2Vec

# Experiment
1. Potter Stemmer and CountVectorizer
2. Lemmatisation and CountVectorizer
